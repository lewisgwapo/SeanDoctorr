                        <h2>Statue of Liberty</h2>
                        <p>The Statue of Liberty is one of the most iconic landmarks in the United States, located on Liberty Island in New York
                        Harbor. It was a gift from France to the United States, symbolizing freedom and democracy. Visitors can admire the
                        statue from the shore, take a ferry to the island, and even climb to the crown for a stunning view of the city skyline</p>
                        <p>This place is special to me because I’ve always been fascinated by its symbol of hope and liberty. I’ve seen it in
                        movies and pictures, and I’ve dreamed of standing in front of it, taking in its grand presence. Visiting the Statue of
                        Liberty would be a memorable experience, reminding me of its historical importance.</p>
                        <p>To get to the Statue of Liberty from the Philippines, fly to New York City through John F. Kennedy International Airport
                        (JFK) or Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). From there, head to Battery Park in Manhattan or Liberty State Park
