                <h2>Experiences</h2>
                <p>
                    College has been really hard for me because I don’t learn fast. I also get distracted by my own
                    thoughts a lot, which
                    makes it harder to focus. At first, BSIT was not my choice. I wanted to take Culinary, HRM, Biology,
                    or Mechanical
                    Engineering. I thought all of these courses would be difficult, except Culinary. I’ve always loved
                    cooking, and the idea
                    of making people happy with food was something I was passionate about. But Culinary is too expensive
                    for my family
                    because of the projects, equipment, and uniforms. I didn’t want to burden them financially, so I had
                    to make a more
                    practical choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Choosing BSIT wasn’t easy. I knew it would be a challenge since I wasn’t very interested in coding
                    at first. There were
                    times I doubted myself and thought I wouldn’t make it. Sometimes, I would procrastinate and waste
                    time because I felt
                    overwhelmed. I’d scroll on my phone for hours or get lost in my own thoughts, thinking about what my
                    life would be like
                    if I pursued Culinary or HRM instead. But eventually, I reminded myself why I’m here.
                </p>
                <p>My main goal is to graduate and start working as soon as possible. I want to help my family and give
                    back to them. Once
                    I gain enough work experience, I plan to go to Abu Dhabi. It’s been a long-time dream of mine to
                    work abroad, explore
                    new places, and experience life outside of my comfort zone. I know it won’t be easy, but I’m
                    determined to make it
                    happen.</p>
                <p>College has also taught me the importance of patience and perseverance. Every time I finish a
                    difficult project or pass
                    an exam I thought I’d fail, I feel proud. It’s these small wins that keep me going. I may not be the
                    best student, but
                    I’m trying my best every single day. And even though this isn’t the path I originally wanted, I’m
                    learning to embrace it
                    and grow from it.</p>

                        achievement for me. It gave me the chance to help my community and improve my leadership skills.

                        photographer for UE Dawn, which allows me to improve my photography skills and gain experience

                    <li><strong>Bought my own PC</strong> – This year, I was able to buy my own PC using my own money. I

                    <li><strong>Won in a gamble</strong> – One time, I bet only 200 pesos and won over 13,000 pesos. It
                        was an unexpected but exciting moment for me.</li>
                    <li><strong>Started my small business</strong> – I started selling Graham Bars to earn extra income.
                        It may be a small business, but it helped me financially and taught me how to manage money.</li>
                    <li><strong>Completed a photography project</strong> – I worked on a photography project that
                        required creativity and patience. Seeing the final results made me feel proud.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attended leadership seminars</strong> – I have attended several leadership seminars,
                        which helped me develop confidence and communication skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced studies and work</strong> – Even though college is hard, I have learned to
                        manage my time between studies, work, and personal life. It is not easy, but I am doing my best.
