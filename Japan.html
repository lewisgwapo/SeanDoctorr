                        <h2>Tokyo</h2>
                        <p>Tokyo is the capital city of Japan, known for its tall
                            buildings, busy streets, and bright lights. It is a place where modern technology and
                            traditional culture come together. You can visit famous places like Tokyo Tower, Shibuya
                            Crossing, and Sensoji Temple.</p>
                        <p> When I was a kid, I often saw Tokyo in movies
                            and on TV. I dreamed of walking through the crowded streets, seeing the lights, and trying
                            delicious Japanese food. It always seemed like a fun and exciting place to visit.</p>
                        <p>To get to Tokyo from the Philippines, you can take a direct flight from
                            Manila, Cebu, or Clark to Narita or Haneda Airport. The flight usually takes around 4 to 5
                            hours.</p>

                        <h2>Mount Fuji</h2>
                        <p>Mount Fuji is the tallest mountain in Japan, known for
                            its beautiful views and peaceful surroundings. The snow on its peak and the green forests
                            around it make it a wonderful place to visit. Many people enjoy taking pictures and hiking
                            there.</p>
                        <p>When I was a kid, I saw pictures of Mount
                            Fuji in books and always wanted to see it in real life. I dreamed of standing in front of
                            the mountain and enjoying its beauty.</p>
                        <p>To get to Mount Fuji from Tokyo, you can take a bus from Shinjuku Station,
                            which takes about 2 to 2.5 hours. Another option is to ride a train on the JR Chuo Line to
                            Otsuki Station, then take the Fujikyu Railway to Kawaguchiko Station.</p>

                            where visitors can experience the world of ninjas through interactive attractions and
                            performances. The village is designed to look like an ancient ninja town, with fun
                            activities like obstacle courses, shuriken throwing, and ninja shows. It’s a great place for
                            anime and ninja fans.</p>
                        <p>This place is special to me because I grew up
                            watching Naruto every morning as a kid, and I’m still a big fan. I’ve finished watching
                            Naruto and now I’m watching Boruto, continuing the story I’ve loved for years. Visiting
                            Shinobi-zato would feel like stepping into the ninja world I’ve admired for so long.</p>
                        <p>To get to Shinobi-zato, you can travel to Nijigen no Mori on Awaji Island.
                            From Osaka or Kobe, take a bus or train to Awaji Island and then a short taxi or shuttle
                            ride to the park.</p>
